# Spatial-Transformer-Augmented-Faster-R-CNN
__UPDATE__: this implementation was the initial work done at school. It is incomplete and does not cover many important aspects comparing to the caffe version.

__NOTE__: this is part of my code for hand detection using deep model. I mainly implemented the framework using Lua within Torch, and Python for preprocessing. 

The image below clearly depicts what I have implemented for this work:
